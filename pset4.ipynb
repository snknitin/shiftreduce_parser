PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework providing a variety of components for constructing neural networks.  You will see how more complicated network architectures than simple feed-forward networks that you have learned in earlier classes can be used to solve a structured prediction problem."

    "# High-Level Overview of the Parser\n",
    "Be sure that you have reviewed the notes on transition-based dependency parsing, and are familiar with the relevant terminology. One small difference is that the text describes `arc-left` and `arc-right` actions, which create arcs between the top of the stack and the front of the buffer; in contrast, the parser you will implement here uses `reduce-left` and `reduce-right` actions, which create arcs between the top two items on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing will proceed as follows:\n",
    "* Initialize your parsing stack and input buffer.\n",
    "* At each step, extract some features.  These can be anything: words in the sentence, the configuration of the stack, the configuration of the input buffer, the previous action, etc.\n",
    "* Send these features through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to get a probability distribution over actions (SHIFT, REDUCE_L, REDUCE_R).  The next action you choose is the one with the highest probability.\n",
    "* If the action is either reduce left or reduce right, you use a neural network to combine the items being reduced and get a dense output to place back on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key classes you will fill in code for are\n",
    "* Feature extraction in `feat_extractors.py`\n",
    "* The `ParserState` class, which keeps track of the input buffer and parse stack, and offers a public interface for doing the parsing actions to update the state\n",
    "* The `TransitionParser` class, which is a PyTorch module where the core parsing logic resides in `parsing.py`.\n",
    "* The neural network components in `neural_net.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The network components are compartmentalized as follows:\n",
    "* **Parsing**: `TransitionParser` is the base component that contains and coordinates the other substitutable components.\n",
    "* **Embedding Lookup**: You will implement two flavors of getting embeddings.  These embeddings are used to initialize the input buffer, and will be shifted on the stack / serve as inputs to the combiner networks (explained below).\n",
    "  - `VanillaWordEmbeddingLookup` just gets embeddings from a lookup table, one per word in the sentence.\n",
    "  - `BiLSTMWordEmbeddingLookup` is more fancy, running a sequence model in both directions over the sentence.  The hidden state at step t is the embedding for the t'th word of the sentence.  \n",
    "* **Action Choosing**: This is a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) that outputs log probabilities over actions\n",
    "* **Combiners**: These networks take the two embeddings of the items being reduced, and combine them into a single embedding. You will create two version of this:\n",
    "  - `MLPCombinerNetwork` takes the two input embeddings and gives a dense output\n",
    "  - `LSTMCombinerNetwork` does a sequence model, where the output embedding is the hidden state of the next timestep."

    "The parsing logic is roughly as follows:\n",
    "* Loop until parsing state is in its terminating state (deliverable 1.2)\n",
    "* Get the features from the parsing state (deliverable 2.1)\n",
    "* Send them through your action chooser network to get log probabilities over actions (deliverable 2.3)\n",
    "* If you have `gold_actions`, do that.  Otherwise (when predicting), take the argmax of your log probabilities and do that.\n",
    "  - Argmax is gross in PyTorch, so a function is provided for you in utils.argmax.\n",
    "  - While the gold actions will always be valid, if you are not provided gold actions, you must make sure\n",
    "    that any action you do is legal.  You cannot shift when the input buffer contains only `END_OF_INPUT_TOK` (this token should *NOT* be shifted onto the stack) and you cannot reduce when the stack contains fewer than 2 elements.\n",
    "    **If your network chooses `SHIFT` when it is not legal, just do `REDUCE_R`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to keep track of the things that the function wants to keep track of\n",
